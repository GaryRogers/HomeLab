# homeLab

## Overview

Configuration for a home AI/Server Lab, an exploration of LLMs, and system administration solutions that I have a professional curiosity in.

## Core Tenants

- Use Configuration Management where possible.
- Off-Load LLM tasks to GamingPC, which has an NVidia GPU
- Use K3s to host containers
- Use Bonjour for name resolution since we don't want to host our own DNS.
- Use Copilot for questions about set-up, but don't have it do the work.
- Use the ubuntu/debian firewall
